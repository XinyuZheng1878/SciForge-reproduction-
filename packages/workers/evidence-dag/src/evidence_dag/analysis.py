"""Load-bearing & fragility analysis (承重 / 脆弱分析).

Answers the scientist's structural question: *if this study were retracted,
which of my conclusions collapse?* (e.g. the PREDIMED 2018 re-analysis).

Built on the `supports` sub-DAG via DOMINATOR analysis. Add a virtual root that
points at every source; a node `x` then **dominates** a derived node `c` iff
EVERY evidence path from the sources to `c` passes through `x`. Removing a
dominator disconnects `c` from all evidence — it is a single point of failure.

- load-bearing power of a node = how many derived nodes it dominates (would
  collapse without it). Sources AND pivotal reasoning steps both count.
- fragility of a conclusion = does it have any single point of failure (a
  dominator), how few independent sources back it, is it contradicted, and is
  its aggregate support below the verification bar.

Pure + deterministic; no LLM, no network. Phase 1 leaves the graph untouched —
this is a read-only view over the existing DAG.
