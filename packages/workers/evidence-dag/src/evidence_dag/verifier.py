"""Verification layer L2 (1B).

Each `supports` edge gets ν∈[0,1] = how strongly the premise (src, evidence)
SUPPORTS the hypothesis (dst, claim/reasoning) — evidential support, NOT strict
logical entailment, so concrete findings / data / partial evidence count to the
degree they back the claim. Each `contradicts` edge likewise gets ν∈[0,1] = how
strongly the premise CONTRADICTS the hypothesis. Hypotheses are split into
sentences and scored as the max over sentences (paragraph-level judging degrades).

Per-node status uses noisy-OR aggregation against a threshold (default 0.7):
  source                                  -> supported  (evidence by definition)
  derived, support≥thr, contradiction≥thr -> conflicting (stands AND is contested)
  derived, support≥thr                     -> supported
  otherwise                                -> unverified
